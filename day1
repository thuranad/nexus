#Python beginners stuff. Brought to you by bees. 

#Objects: Basically containers for something. You add value to them as they're used for storage. Imagine a lunchbox. 
#Let's assign a value to an object. How about bees? Bees are fun. 

number_of_bees = 100

#Let's look at data types now. Integers are whole number values. Floats are decimal value types. Strings are a sequence of characters.
#Let's try assigning values to these now. 

my_beeswarm = 40
my_pollencount = 30.85
my_beehive = "Mount Beeverest." 

#Time to print things to the screen. 
#Let's think of something memorable...

print("Oh my god they're in my eyes!")

#So what about printing integers and strings on the same call? Well for that we use f0strings. It'll take care of data types.

name = Beevis
my_integer = 3
print(f"{name} is {my_integer} years old.")

#Now for math. I hate math. But math is important to bees so we'll just have to learn it. Good thing is that math is REALLY easy in python.

a = 5
b = 7
number_of_bees = a + b
number_of_flowers = a * b
number_of_hives = a / b

#Time for User Input. What if someone wanted to input their own data values instead? 
#What if those values are strings that have outputs depending on if/else?
#In this next one we're asking the user what kind of bees they are and saying a thing depending on the answer. 

bee_type = input("Are those European or Africanised honey bees I see? ")
its_fine = "Ohhh cool. Safe bro. "
its_not_fine = "Get away from those now bro. "
 
if bee_type == "European":
    print(its_fine)

if bee_type == "Africanised":
    print(its_not_fine.upper())

else:
    print("That isn't a bee that can be found here. ")



#Now it's time for lists. It's basically what it says on the tin, a series of items grouped together. 

bees = ["African", "European", "Asian, "Hybrid"] 

#So how do we get the data OUT of a list? 

bees = ["African", "European", "Asian, "Hybrid"]
